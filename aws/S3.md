## S3 101
- it is object storage: flat files like movies, images, documents
- a file can have up to 5 TB
- a bucket is like a folder
- S3 bucket names must be unique: https://marian.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
- buckets are viewed globally, but they are created in a region
- an S3 Object (a file) consists of:
    - key (name of the object)
    - value (data itself)
    - versionId
    - metadata
    - subresources (access control lists, torrents)
- *Data consistency*: 
    - if you write a new file, you will be able to read it imediately after that. 
    - if you update an existing file, you may get the older version or the new version 
- *Tiered storage with lifecycle mananagement*: 
    - Standard
    - IA (Infrequent Access) 
    - One Zone IA
    - Inteligent Tiering - there is a charge for management which can be high if you have a large number of objects
    - Glacier
    - Glacier Deep Archive

- *Charging based on*: storage, requests, storage management pricing, data transfer pricing, transfer acceleration, cross region replication pricing

- by default, a bucket has public access restricted. You can enable the public access option on the bucket and then *Make public* individual objects

- *Restrict bucket access*: bucket policies, object policies, IAM

- *encryption in transit*: (SSL/TLS)
- *encryption at rest*
    - server side: S3 Managed Keys, AWS Key Management Service, Customer Keys
    - client side

- when using *versioning*, yuo have to make public each individual version
- *versioning* cannot be disabled, but it can be suspended
- when deleting an object, a delete marker is placed on the object, but the object is not deleted

- *life cycle management*: automate moving objects between different storage tiers

- *S3 performance*
    - S3 has low latency. You can get the first byte out of S3 within 100-200 miliseconds
    - mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/myfile.jpg -> the prefix is: */folder1/subfolder1*
    - 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5500 GET/HEAD requests per second/prefix
    - you can get better performance by spreading reads across different prefixes
    - if you use SSE-KMS to encrypt the objects in S3, keep in mind the KMS limits
- *S3 Select* - a way to get only the data you need from an object (like a .csv file) using SQL expression. You save mony on data transfer and speed.
